# Travel-Todo List

This is a simple travel-todo list application built with React. It allows users to add items they need for their trip, mark them as packed, and sort or delete items from the list. The application also persists the list in the local storage.

# Features

- Add Items: Users can add items with a quantity to their packing list.
- Mark as Packed: Items can be marked as packed by checking the checkbox, which will strike through the item.
- Sort Items: Items can be sorted by input order, description, or packed status.
- Delete Items: Individual items can be deleted from the list.
- Clear List: Users can clear the entire list.
- Local Storage: The list is saved to local storage, so it persists even after refreshing the page.
